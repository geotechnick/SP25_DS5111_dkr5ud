# SP25_DS5111_dkr5ud

from github root directory run sh init.sh to run the shell script (this makes sure you can run the makefile)

from the root run "make" command
copy and paste the result into the command line to run the makefile

use "make update" to set up the virtual environment

to see the tree structure run tree run ". -I env"

```
the intent of adding the tree structure was to give the reader an overview of what is in the repo,
this directing them to run the tree command kinda misses the point.  Also, would be nice to give the README
some structure with titles and capitalization
```
